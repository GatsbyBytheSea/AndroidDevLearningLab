# Android Development Projects – IMT Atlantique MOBAPP Course

> 📱 A personal repository documenting my learning journey in Android development using Java and Gradle during the MOBAPP course at IMT Atlantique.

## 📚 Introduction

This repository contains the teaching projects I completed as part of the **MOBAPP (Mobile Applications)** course at **IMT Atlantique**. Throughout the course, I delved into Android development using **Java**, guided by best practices, real-world use cases, and hands-on mini-projects.

The goal was not only to master the tools, but to deeply understand how Android applications work under the hood — from UI design to sensor usage and data persistence.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

| Category          | Tool / Language        |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| OS                | Windows                |
| Terminal          | PowerShell             |
| IDE               | Android Studio         |
| Language          | Java                   |
| Build Tool        | Gradle                 |
| Version Control   | Git                    |

## 🎯 Course Objectives

According to the [official course description](https://formations.imt-atlantique.fr/introductionAndroid/presentation-elective.html#description-et-objectifs-p%C3%A9dagogiques), the MOBAPP course focuses on enabling students to:

- Understand the **Android component model** that underpins every application.
- Design and build **user interfaces** adapted for mobile terminals.
- Develop applications that:
    - Work on a variety of mobile devices;
    - Handle **persistent data** (e.g., files, storage);
    - Utilize built-in **sensors** (e.g., GPS, accelerometer);
    - Integrate **mapping features** and location services.

## 🧩 What I Learned

Through a set of modular projects and exercises, I explored all the key aspects of Android development, including:

- ✅ Setting up and configuring Android Studio with Gradle.
- ✅ Building Activities, Fragments, and Services using the Android component model.
- ✅ Designing responsive and intuitive UI with XML and Java.
- ✅ Implementing file-based data persistence and local storage.
- ✅ Integrating GPS/geolocation and capturing media from device hardware.
- ✅ Using Android’s Maps and location APIs for cartographic features.
